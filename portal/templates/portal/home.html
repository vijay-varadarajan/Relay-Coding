              Relay Coding is not your typical hackathon - it's a fusion of innovation and exhilarating side-games. Participants solve real-world problems and collaborate with your teammates to conquer side-games together. It's not just a hackathon; it's a bonding experience.
              The trademark of this event is the relay format side challenges. These challenges will add a twist to the competition, and possibly shuffle the leaderboard. Side-games inject an extra layer of excitement and refreshment to the hackathon experience.
